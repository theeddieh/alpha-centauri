Firaxis est une compagnie que j'ai fondée avec quelques amis.
L'idée était de revenir à quelque chose de petit. Lorsque Microprose
a démarré, c'était une petite compagnie, et c'était très amusant. En
dix ou douze ans, elle a pris de plus en plus d'importance et à
partir d'un certain moment, il devenait temps de revenir à un environnement
beaucoup plus petit, sans les pressions et les problèmes financiers
d'une grosse compagnie. En gros, le moment était idéal pour créer une
petite société et pour ne plus s'occuper que de jeux.
