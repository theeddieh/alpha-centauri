** Notes
************************************************************

-- This patch will attempt to locate your installation of 
   Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, and defaults to that location, if found.
   If the patch cannot locate Alpha Centauri, it will default to
   C:\Program Files\Firaxis Games\Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri.

   In this situation, you should ensure the patch installs to the
   directory that you have installed Alpha Centauri into.


-- This patch is a Windows 2000/XP compatibility update, to allow 
   users of Windows 2000 or XP to run Alpha Centauri.   It is not required
   for users of Windows 95, 98, or ME.  However, users with these 
   operating systems may will need to install this patch if they wish to
   play multiplayer games with other players who have installed this patch.


-- There is a known issue with sounds skipping on Windows ME machines.  This
   should not affect the game stability.
