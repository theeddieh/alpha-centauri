$TITLE1 $NAME2 of the $FACTION3: Your faction has prospered, and now 
controls two bases. Sparta Command, your Headquarters, has nearly 
completed a {Former} unit, which may be used to build terrain improvements.  
Meanwhile, scouting parties to the north report the existence of a 
mysterious {alien artifact} guarded by lurking Mind Worms. 
^
Your objectives:
^1. Once completed, use the Former unit to build three terrain 
   improvements. One option: press {"Shift-A"} to automate the Former, and it 
   immediately begins building terrain improvements.
^
2. After your Former is complete, {build a Network Node} at Sparta Command. Press the 
'=' key if you need instructions on how to build the Network Node during the game.
^
3. Move your troops to the north. {Defeat} any Mind Worms, {capture} the alien 
   artifact, and {bring it back} to Sparta Command.

If you need to review your objectives in the game, press the '=' key or select "Review Scenario 
Objectives" from the HQ menu.
