INTRODUCTION
This new scenario, "Race for Wealth," again involves the alien Borehole Cluster. If you haven't played the
4-Player scenario "Fight for the Borehole" then you may wish to download and play that
before playing this scenario. This scenario is meant to be played by two human players. It
can be played against the AI, but you'll most likely win from either side. 

BACKGROUND
On a small island, the Borehole Cluster has been discovered. The Peacekeepers and the
University are vying for control of this area. They've each built up a small base of power,
and both are ready to make their move. Your objective as either side is to expand as much
as possible.

TACTICAL NOTES
The University begins with a slight edge in technology (attack-5 as opposed to attack-4) and
a slightly larger credit balance. However, this initial advantage is all they get: trying to
gain new tech during the course of the scenario is a dangerous tactic. You're better off
using any artifacts that you find to help advance the production of your units (simply
disband the artifact in the base).

The Peacekeepers have slightly weaker forces, but a larger production base and the natural
ability to grow their bases to even greater size. Exploit this advantage as early and as
quickly as possible; don't forget to consider building sea colony pods, as they score points
for occupied territory as well.

For both sides, the key is (as one might expect) control of the Boreholes. These squares mine
five or six minerals apiece, and can make the difference in a closely fought battle. Watch your
borders and build a forward base or two to exploit these riches, and you'll most likely
sweep your opponent away.

A final note: 100 points are required for victory, so although it is unlikely, it is
possible for the game to end in a draw.

Good luck, and let us know how you fare with this scenario!
