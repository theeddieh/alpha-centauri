M.Y. $DATE4: The Spartans have spent the years since Planetfall 
building advanced weapon systems instead of tending to their 
infrastructure. By contrast, the Peacekeepers have spent their 
resources on several grand Secret Projects, neglecting their 
frontier's defense. The Spartan High Command now realizes that 
unless its military might is immediately utilized, the 
Peacekeepers will establish an unsurpassable lead. 
^
$TITLE1 $NAME2 of the $FACTION3, you must control more Secret Projects 
than your opponent by M.Y. $NUM3. If either faction at any time controls 
seven Projects, that faction is considered to have a commanding lead 
and automatically wins control of Planet!
