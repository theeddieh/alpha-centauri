#caption GAIA'S REVENGE
^^
It is now M.Y. $DATE4, and Planet is poised on the brink of a final 
Armageddon. The Morgans control the west, wantonly befouling their 
continent with vast tracts of Thermal Boreholes in the center of 
their empire. The Gaians control the east, and have been slowly
building an armada of native units bent on restoring ecological
harmony to their world. 
^
The Gaians intend to take over the most polluted Morgan bases, while 
the Morgans seek to retain these jewels of their industrial crown 
and put an end to the wasteful struggle by conquering the Gaian capital.
Victory will go to the leader who controls all six objective bases--five 
Morgan bases plus the Gaian capital.
