M.Y. $DATE4: In the west, The University has gloried in its 
ivory towers since Planetfall, content to pursue scientific 
advances unrestrained by moral concerns. To the east, the 
Believers have prepared a crusade to cleanse Planet of the
perceived blasphemy of the University and bring more souls
into the fold.
^
For both factions, population equals power. The faction controlling
the most population in M.Y. $NUM3 shall control the future. If
either faction at any time controls more than 100 population, that faction
will dominate the future of Planet and is considered the victor.
