INTRODUCTION
This new scenario introduces a new alien landmark, The Borehole Cluster. Further
information (or perhaps just tantalizing hints) about the origin and purpose of this
artifact will be available in the months to come. In the meantime, the scenario is a
straightforward one of conquest (in fact, no Colony Pods can be built during this scenario). 

BACKGROUND
The Believers hold the Cluster, as represented by the fact that Blessed Saviour is marked
as an Objective Base. Their enemies, the Gaians, have teamed up with Santiago's Spartans
to try to wrest control of the Cluster away. Miriam might be able to hold out against
the combined might of the Spartans and Gaians for a while, but to stabilize the situation
in the area, she must also conquer Song of Planet, a Gaian base that represents the
local power of the Gaians. The Believers can count on a little help from
their own allies, the Hive.

TACTICAL NOTES
You can play any of the four sides in this scenario. Try them all and see how you do!
Remember, to get a "draw" (i.e. hang on to your Objective base) is easy. The challenge
comes in trying to preserve your own Objective while capturing the enemy-held Objective
before the scenario end.

Believers: At first you'll be hard pressed. As your forces build, make sure to keep a
balance between defense and attack. You can hold Blessed Saviour pretty easily--but if you
overcommit production and forces to defense, you won't have time to capture Song of Planet.

Spartans: You must balance speed with operational considerations--trying to bypass Believer
strongholds could lead to having too long a supply line, and a too-powerful defense by the
time you arrive in force. It might be better to capture Lord's Grace, then stage your
invasion of the Objective from there. Keep in mind that you might need to bleed off a small
number of forces to help the Gaians preserve Song of Planet.

Gaians: You'll have a difficult time, but remember that psi combat ignores defense factors.
Watch your rear for Hive incursions, and keep your forces strong and together as you assault
the Believer Objective. Piecemeal attacks are doomed to fail!

Hive: You're on the periphery of the battle, but if you marshall the right types of forces
(some cheap forces to battle mindworms, and regular troops to face speeders and infantry)
and move quickly, you can capture Song of Planet before time runs out. You'll have to count
on your Believer allies to hold on to Blessed Saviour, but they can usually do it--though
a unit or two from you couldn't hurt, if you can spare them.

Good luck, and let us know how you fare with this scenario!
